    <h1>History of Hip Hop & RNB</h1>
    <p>This site was made for people who love the culture as much as I do. From the block parties in the Bronx to streaming charts today — hip hop has always been about expression, truth, and storytelling.</p>

    <h2>Legendary Artists</h2>
    <p>These are just a few names that shaped the game. Everyone has their own top 5, but here are some that changed the culture forever:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tupac Shakur</strong> — voice of the people, poet, revolutionary</li>
      <li><strong>The Notorious B.I.G.</strong> — smooth flow, raw stories, Brooklyn’s finest</li>
      <li><strong>Lauryn Hill</strong> — one of the greatest voices to ever bless both rap and soul</li>

  <section id="regions">
    <h2>Regional Influence</h2>
    <p>Each region brought something different to the sound and the story. Hip hop wouldn’t be what it is today without the local flavor each area added:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>East Coast:</strong> Gritty beats and deep lyrics — think Nas, Biggie, Jay-Z</li>
      <li><strong>West Coast:</strong> Laid back flows with hard messages — Tupac, N.W.A, Snoop</li>
      <li><strong>South:</strong> Bass-heavy, bounce and trap energy — Outkast, Lil Wayne, Future</li>
      <li><strong>Midwest:</strong> Fast flows and clever lines — Kanye, Twista, Bone Thugs</li>
    </ul>
