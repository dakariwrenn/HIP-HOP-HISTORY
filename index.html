    <h1>History of Hip Hop & RNB</h1>
    <p>This page is for the real ones — the ones who grew up on bass lines, mixtapes, and lyrical heat. Hip hop isn’t just music, it’s how we speak, dress, move, and survive. From a Bronx basement to global stages — this is our culture, and this is our tribute to it.</p>

  <section id="artists">
    <h2>Legendary Artists</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tupac Shakur</strong> — More than an artist, a voice for the unheard.</li>
      <li><strong>The Notorious B.I.G.</strong> — Smooth flow, raw stories, Brooklyn royalty.</li>
      <li><strong>Lauryn Hill</strong> — Soul, truth, and bars that cut deep.</li>
      <li><strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> — The modern prophet of our generation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="regions">
    <h2>Regional Influence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>East Coast:</strong> This is where it all began — gritty beats, complex bars. You feel the hunger in every line from Nas, Biggie, Jay-Z and more.</li>
      <li><strong>West Coast:</strong> A sound born in the sun and soaked in funk. N.W.A, Snoop, Tupac — their stories came from the streets and hit the world hard.</li>
      <li><strong>South:</strong> The South brought the bounce. From Outkast to Lil Wayne to Future, southern rap has always had its own flavor, and now it dominates the charts.</li>
      <li><strong>Midwest:</strong> Fast flows, real talk. Think Kanye’s creativity, Twista’s speed, and Bone Thugs’ harmony. The Midwest is the underdog with heart.</li>
    </ul>
